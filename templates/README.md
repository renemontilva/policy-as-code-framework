## Templates Directory Overview

The `templates/` directory promotes consistency and efficiency within the Policy as Code (PaC) framework by providing reusable policy templates.

### Purpose

This directory is designed to:

- Streamline the creation of new policies by offering pre-defined templates.
- Ensure uniformity across policies to adhere to organizational standards.
- Simplify the process of adapting policies for different environments and subdomains.

### Key Features

- **Reusable Templates**: Pre-built templates serve as a starting point for creating new policies, reducing duplication and saving time.
- **Customizability**: Templates can be modified to suit specific use cases, environments, or subdomain requirements.
- **Standardization**: Ensures that all policies align with the organization's best practices and compliance needs.

### Best Practices

1. **Template Selection**: Choose a template that closely matches the policy you want to create.
2. **Customization**: Adapt the template to meet the specific needs of your environment or use case.
3. **Version Control**: Track changes to templates to maintain consistency and ensure traceability.

### Example Usage

1. Navigate to the `templates/` directory.
2. Copy the relevant template to your desired location:
   ```bash
   cp templates/policy_name.rego policies/security/global/policy_name.rego
   ```
3. Customize the copied template as required.
